<p>I totally get it. I used to be right where you are. Juggling between work, being a mom, and wife was no easy task. I was too busy wearing these many hats that I barely had time to nourish myself the way my body deserves. Before I realized my situation, I started experiencing decreased energy levels, fatigue and increased daytime sleepiness in addition to being over 20 pounds overweight. At some point I found myself trying different diet programs, enrolled in the best gyms, did everything I could but I only got more frustrated because nothing seemed to be getting me where I needed to be. I became a frustrated yo-yo dieter because none of the processes were sustainable. I
I reached a turning point in my life over a decade later, when I went for my routine checkup with my doctor and I was highly disappointed to see my test results. From that moment on, I knew I had to do something, the right way!
So, I went on a journey to discover how to get my groove back. What I discovered not only dropped those unhealthy weights, but also rocked my world!</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>
  I became very passionate about how these discoveries affected
  my life as well as my family’s that I started telling others and I watched
   them transform too. This best part of this experience is when I saw my childre
   n making healthy choices too, without being forced to. I’m so grateful to have modeled a healthy lifestyle my children admire especially since they have made these healthy choices from a more empowered place-within themselves!
</p><br><br>
<p>This is why my program is created for the unique YOU, to help you get started in feeling better and ultimately feel your best while attaining your ideal weight and become an authentic inspiration to your loved ones.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Being a Certified Holistic Wellness Coach, I have come to understand why
   most diets fail to work for 100 percent of people. This is mainly because the
    root cause of the stubborn weight is not addressed. When I work 1:1 with my clients, we get to the root cause of the problem
  , bring the body into balance and watch the extra pounds melt away for good!</p>
