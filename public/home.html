    <p>i was tired of being tired, and i desperetely needed help learning a new wayto live,
    so i called Nourished super mom<br/><br/>
    unlike many or even myself in the past,my reason for calling was not just to learn how to shed
    a few excess pounds, it was to learn new way of living that didn't leave me exhausted a 2pm each day,
    to learn a way to manage the stresses and hectic pace of my life,and most importantly to
    learn how to make foods that worked for and not against me.And so,a 16-week journey to transform began!
